# Implementation Plan: Stage 5.1 + Stage 6 — Session Semantics & Tool Runtime

**Status:** Delivered — 2026-08-13. Stage 5.1 and Stage 6 core runtime are implemented and verified; immediate termination of an already-running native shell subprocess remains a documented Stage 6.1 follow-up because the current DevTools write policy blocked that specific subprocess binding change.

## Overview

This delivery first locks the Session/Context invariants agreed after Stage 5, then introduces a first-class local Tool Runtime between AgentLoop and native tool implementations. The Server remains persistence-only. MCP transport, OS-level sandboxing, WAL, cloud conflict resolution, and Subagent Runtime remain out of scope.

## Architecture Decisions

- Session history is an append-only semantic tree. New entries are appended as children of the current `activeEntry`; existing entries are never rewritten in place.
- A newer compaction checkpoint supersedes older checkpoints for model context projection while every historical compaction entry remains in the Session Tree.
- Session restore restores durable `Tree + activeEntry`; messages, runtime state, and latest compaction checkpoint are projections of that branch.
- Session-tree event colors and timestamp colors are semantic theme tokens, not hard-coded UI colors.
- AgentLoop decides when a tool step runs; Tool Runtime decides whether and how the tool executes, how cancellation/timeout is propagated, and how execution status is normalized.
- Native tools are the first Tool Runtime executor. MCP remains a future executor/source adapter.
- Permission policy is introduced as an interface with `allow | deny | ask`; this stage ships deterministic local policy enforcement but not an interactive approval UI or OS sandbox.

## Phase 1: Stage 5.1 Semantic Lock

### Task 1: Lock compaction supersession semantics

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `compact2` compacts the previous checkpoint plus newly compacted history.
- Context projection contains only the latest effective checkpoint plus post-checkpoint history.
- Old compaction entries remain in Session Tree history.

**Verification:** focused Context and Session Tree tests.

### Task 2: Lock append-only Session Tree / restore semantics

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Appending after a historical jump creates a child branch without modifying prior entries.
- Restore preserves `activeEntryId` and derives branch messages/runtime/latest checkpoint from projections.

**Verification:** Session Tree tests.

### Task 3: Add semantic Session UI theme tokens

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Session message/tool/compaction/state/branch/error/custom and timestamp colors live in `ThemeColors`.
- Session Tree UI maps entry semantics to theme tokens and contains no hard-coded event colors.

**Verification:** CLI typecheck/build.

## Checkpoint: Session Semantics

- Context + Session Tree tests pass.
- Theme typecheck passes.

## Phase 2: Stage 6 Tool Runtime Foundation

### Task 4: Introduce Tool Runtime contracts

Define provider-independent execution types for:
- Tool capability metadata;
- execution context (`sessionId/runId/turnId/stepId/workspaceRoot/mode/signal`);
- permission decisions;
- normalized execution results and telemetry;
- executor/source boundary.

### Task 5: Adapt native tools to the Runtime

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Native implementations no longer own mode policy.
- Tool Runtime validates visibility through Tool Registry.
- Native filesystem/shell tools receive the runtime AbortSignal.
- Tool-level timeout and cancellation produce normalized statuses.

### Task 6: Wire AgentLoop tool steps through Tool Runtime

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `use-chat` no longer calls `executeLocalTool` directly.
- AgentLoop `context.signal` reaches the Tool Runtime.
- Session `tool_result` captures normalized status/duration while preserving output/error compatibility.

## Checkpoint: Tool Runtime

- Runtime unit tests cover allow/deny/ask, completion, failure, cancellation, and timeout.
- AgentLoop interruption can cancel an active native shell tool.
- Existing AgentLoop behavior remains unchanged.

## Phase 3: Documentation & Delivery

### Task 7: Record architecture decision and current state

- Add ADR for Session semantic invariants + Tool Runtime boundary.
- Update README, CONTEXT, CHANGELOG, current-state notes, and project Agent rules where relevant.

### Task 8: Final verification

- Harness tests pass.
- CLI tests pass.
- Shared/Harness/CLI/Server typechecks pass.
- CLI/Server builds pass.
- `git diff --check` has no whitespace errors.
